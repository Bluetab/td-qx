# Truedat Quality Service

TdQx is a back-end service that supports the third version of Quality used by Truedat.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on
how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

Install dependencies with `mix deps.get`

To start your Phoenix server:

### Installing

- Create and migrate your database with `mix ecto.setup`
- Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`
- Now you can visit [`localhost:4010`](http://localhost:4010) from your browser.

## Running the tests

Run all aplication tests with `mix test`

## Deployment

Ready to run in production? Please [check our deployment
guides](http://www.phoenixframework.org/docs/deployment).

## Environment variables

### SSL conection

- DB_SSL: boolean value, to enable TSL config, by default is false.
- DB_SSL_CACERTFILE: path of the certification authority cert file "/path/to/ca.crt".
- DB_SSL_VERSION: available versions are tlsv1.2, tlsv1.3 by default is tlsv1.2.
- DB_SSL_CLIENT_CERT: Path to the client SSL certificate file.
- DB_SSL_CLIENT_KEY: Path to the client SSL private key file.
- DB_SSL_VERIFY: This option specifies whether certificates are to be verified.

### Elastic bulk page size configuration

 -BULK_PAGE_SIZE_QUALITY_CONTROLS: default 5000
 -BULK_PAGE_SIZE_SCORE_GROUPS: default 5000
 -BULK_PAGE_SIZE_QUALITY_CONTROL_VERSIONS: default 5000

### Elastic aggregations

- The aggregation variables are defined as follows: AGG\_<AGGREGATION_NAME>\_SIZE

## Built With

- [Phoenix](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) - Web framework
- [Ecto](http://www.phoenixframework.org/) - Phoenix and Ecto integration
- [Postgrex](http://hexdocs.pm/postgrex/) - PostgreSQL driver for Elixir
- [Cowboy](https://ninenines.eu) - HTTP server for Erlang/OTP
- [Credo](http://credo-ci.org/) - Static code analysis tool for the Elixir
  language
- [cors_plug](https://hex.pm/packages/cors_plug) - Plug for CORS support
- [ex_machina](https://hex.pm/packages/ex_machina) - A factory library for test
  data

## Environment variables

### Elastic bulk page size configuration

- BULK_PAGE_SIZE_QUALITY_CONTROL_VERSIONS

### ElasticSearch authentication

#### (Optional) Basic HTTP authentication

These environment variables will add the Authentication header on each request
with value `Basic <ES_USERNAME>:<ES_PASSWORD>`

- ES_USERNAME: Username
- ES_PASSWORD: Password

#### (Optional) ApiKey authentication

This environment variables will add the Authentication header on each request
with value `ApiKey <ES_API_KEY>`

- ES_API_KEY: ApiKey

#### (Optional) HTTP SSL Configuration (Normally required for ApiKey authentication)

These environment variables will configure CA Certificates for HTTPS requests

- ES_SSL: [true | false] required to activate following options
- ES_SSL_CACERTFILE: (Optional) Indicate the cacert file path. If not set, a certfile will be automatically generated by `:certifi.cacertfile()`
- ES_SSL_VERIFY: (Optional) [verify_peer | verify_none] defaults to `verify_none`


### ElasticSearch Force Merge Configuration

These environment variables control the force merge operation for ElasticSearch indices, which optimizes index performance by merging segments.

- `ES_WAIT_FOR_COMPLETION`:
  - **Purpose**: Controls whether the force merge operation should wait for completion before returning
  - **Default**: `nil` (no wait)
  - **Usage**: When set to `true`, the operation will wait until the force merge is complete before returning. When `false` or `nil`, the operation returns immediately and runs asynchronously
  - **Performance**: Setting to `true` ensures the operation is complete but may cause longer response times

- `ES_MAX_NUM_SEGMENTS`:
  - **Purpose**: Specifies the maximum number of segments to merge down to
  - **Default**: `5`
  - **Usage**: Controls how aggressively the force merge operation consolidates segments. Lower values result in fewer, larger segments
  - **Performance**: Fewer segments generally improve search performance but may increase memory usage during the merge operation
